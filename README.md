# rstatsd

rstatsd is a ruby based daemon for capturing data from statsd clients.

rstatsd is inspired by the work at etsy to measure everything, measure
anything. They use a combination of node.js and graphite to capture and
graph this data.

The goals of this project are to be simple to install, and easy to request
a graph of any data that is stored in the back-end.
